    ## Context & Product
    We are a mid-sized team (12 engineers) shipping a web app plus background workers
    from a single monorepo. We have dev, staging, and production environments and want
    a predictable release cadence with safe hotfixes.
    
    ## Branching & Environments
    - `main`: always releasable; protected; requires passing CI and reviews.
    - `develop`: integration branch; used for feature work that is not production-ready.
    - `release/x.y`: short-lived branches cut from `main` when we start stabilizing a minor release.
    - `hotfix/x.y.z`: branches cut from the current production tag for urgent fixes.
    
    Environment mapping:
    - Dev: deploys from `develop` (or feature flags off `main` in phase 2).
    - Staging: deploys from `release/x.y` during stabilization.
    - Prod: deploys from annotated tags on `main`.
    
    Branches have clear owners and deletion rules:
    - `release/*` and `hotfix/*` are deleted after they are merged and tagged.
    
    ## Release Train & Cadence
    - Two-week iterations on `develop`, merging ready work to `main` behind feature flags.
    - When we decide to ship, we cut `release/x.y` from `main`, freeze new features,
      and only accept bugfix PRs that target the release branch.
    - Once all checks and smoke tests pass on staging, we tag `vX.Y.0` on `main` and deploy to prod.
    - Tagging script:
      - verifies commit is merged from `release/x.y`,
      - creates an annotated tag,
      - generates a basic changelog from merged PRs.
    
    ## Hotfix & Backport Flow
    - Urgent fixes:
      - Cut `hotfix/x.y.z` from the latest production tag.
      - Apply the minimal fix, run CI, and deploy to staging then prod.
    - Merge directions:
      - `hotfix/x.y.z` -> merge back into `main`.
      - If a `release/x.(y+1)` branch is open, also cherry-pick there when relevant.
    - We maintain a short runbook that spells out exactly which branches must get the fix.
    
    ## History Policy (Rebase vs Merge)
    - `main` is never rebased; only fast-forward or merge commits from protected branches.
    - Individual developers are encouraged to use `git rebase` on local feature branches before opening PRs.
    - `release/*` and `hotfix/*` branches avoid history rewrite after they are public.
    - Reverts:
      - We prefer `git revert` for production issues so history stays auditable.
    
    ## Debugging with the Timeline
    - All production deploys correspond to annotated tags with release notes.
    - Commit messages reference tickets/issues where applicable.
    - When an incident happens:
      - Use tags to narrow the window.
      - Use `git log` and `git bisect` between known-good and known-bad versions.
      - Combine with metrics/logs to confirm the culprit commit.
    - New engineers are onboarded with a short guide on how to read the release history.
    
    ## Rollout & Adoption Plan
    - Phase 1: enforce branch protections and tagging for prod.
    - Phase 2: adopt the release branch model and stabilization window.
    - Phase 3: introduce hotfix/backport runbook and teach the process to the team.
    - Phase 4: refine conventions as we learn from a few incident postmortems.
