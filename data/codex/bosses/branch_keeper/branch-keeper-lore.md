> KAI: "Version control is not a suggestion."

The **Branch Keeper** is the first major boss of **THE TIMELINE (world-git)**.

In-universe, it patrols a constellation of branches, pull requests, and tags.  
Your task is to decide the **safe sequence of Git operations** for small scenarios:

- Feature branch behind main,
- Diverged histories,
- Conflicting changes,
- Release tags and hotfixes.

The boss tests whether you understand:

- When to **merge** vs **rebase**,
- How to resolve conflicts without losing work,
- How to keep history clean and explainable.
