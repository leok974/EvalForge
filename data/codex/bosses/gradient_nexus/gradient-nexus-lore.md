> KAI: "Welcome to the part where 'it runs' isn't enough. It has to *learn*."

The **Gradient Nexus** is the first major boss of **THE SYNAPSE (world-ml)**.

In-universe, it controls a training cluster that will only open for models that train, evaluate, and report **honestly**.

Your task: implement a small training pipeline for a simple dataset (e.g. tabular or tiny image/text), including:

- Train/validation split,
- Training loop,
- Metric computation,
- Basic overfitting detection.
