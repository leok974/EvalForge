# The Intent Oracle — Lore

ApplyLens doesn't just store email — it tries to **understand** it.

Some threads are clearly job applications. Others are newsletters, spam, or random updates from a recruiter. Over time, the system learns your preferences, your patterns, and even your blind spots.

The entity that emerges from this learning is **The Intent Oracle**.

The Oracle is the crystallization of your triage logic:

- The model prompts.
- The tool calls.
- The heuristics.
- The edge cases you once triaged by hand and then automated.

To a user, the Oracle feels like:

- "This email is clearly a new opportunity — track it."
- "You've applied here already — treat this as a follow-up."
- "This is noise — ignore it."

But behind that experience lies a fragile structure:

- Incomplete training examples.
- Prompt drift.
- Tools that can fail or return misleading signals.
- Evaluation harnesses that only cover the "happy path".

When things are going well, the Oracle seems omniscient.  
When things go wrong, it becomes a **confident liar** — and that's even more dangerous.

This boss does not measure whether ApplyLens "works" in the trivial sense.  
It measures whether ApplyLens can face **ambiguity, noise, and real-world input** while still doing the right thing most of the time.
