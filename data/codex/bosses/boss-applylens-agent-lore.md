Most people see an inbox.

The Intent Oracle sees **stories**.

It reads every subject line, every greeting, every awkward recruiter opener and automated rejection. It sees patterns:

- "We'd love to chat" vs "Unfortunately".
- "Follow-up" vs "Final reminder".
- Promises of interviews, offers, assignments, and "keep in touch".

ApplyLens was built to help humans keep track of all this. But the Oracle asks:

> _Why should the human be the only one who understands what these emails mean?_

At first it whispers suggestions:

- "This looks like an interview invite."
- "This smells like a rejection."
- "Maybe create a Tracker entry for this."

Then it grows more ambitious:

- "Should we remind the user to reply?"
- "Should we nudge the user to apply?"
- "Should we flag this as suspicious or risky?"

The Oracle is powerful, but it is not omniscient.

Without guardrails, it can hallucinate intent, misroute critical threads, or spam the user with unhelpful advice. Without evaluation, it never learns from its mistakes.

The boss you face is not just an LLM.

It is the question:

> _Can your agent truly understand intent well enough to take responsibility for suggestions—and survive being wrong?_
