    ## Use Case & Requirements
    We are designing a multi-agent assistant that helps engineers debug production issues
    by searching logs, querying metrics, and proposing remediation steps.
    The system must be safe, observable, and able to improve over time.
    
    ## Agent Graph & Roles
    - Planner Agent: reads the user problem, proposes a plan, and decomposes into steps.
    - Tools Router: decides which tool-capable agent should handle each step.
    - Logs Agent: specialized in log search and summarization with a limited tool set.
    - Metrics Agent: queries metrics and explains anomalies.
    - Fix Draft Agent: proposes remediation steps with explicit 'DO / DO NOT' sections.
    - Safety Guard Agent: reviews actions and outputs against policy before they reach the user.
    - Evaluator Agent: scores completed runs and suggests improvements.
    
    State:
    - A central Run State holds the user request, plan, step results, and decisions.
    - Each agent reads/writes specific fields; the orchestrator enforces boundaries.
    
    ## Tool Contracts & IO
    Each tool is defined with a typed contract:
    - `search_logs(query: string, window: TimeRange) -> LogSummary`
    - `query_metric(name: string, window: TimeRange) -> MetricSummary`
    - `open_ticket(summary: string, details: string) -> TicketRef`
    
    Contracts:
    - Inputs/outputs have JSON schemas with explicit field names and types.
    - Errors: all tools return structured error objects, not raw exceptions.
    - Timeouts and retries: tools enforce time limits; the orchestrator handles retries with backoff.
    - Only the Tools Router can invoke tools directly; worker agents must request tool calls via intents.
    
    ## Policy & Guardrails
    - Global safety policy is enforced by the Safety Guard Agent.
    - Safety Guard checks:
      - No direct destructive actions (e.g., executing shell commands) are allowed in this system.
      - No PII is logged or echoed back.
      - Remediation suggestions are written as 'proposed steps', not auto-applied changes.
    - Per-agent prompts include role-specific constraints (e.g., Logs Agent cannot open tickets).
    - Denials:
      - If a proposed action violates policy, the Safety Guard blocks it,
        adds a policy_violation entry to run state, and returns a safe explanation to the user.
    
    ## Observability & Run State
    - Each run has a unique run_id.
    - For every agent step, we log:
      - run_id, agent_name, step_index, inputs (redacted), outputs (redacted), tool calls, and timing.
    - We emit traces that show the full decision tree of the run.
    - Run state is persisted with a compact summary and links to logs/traces.
    
    ## Evaluation & Improvement Loop
    - Metrics:
      - Task success rate (did the user accept the proposed explanation/remediation?).
      - Tool error rate and timeouts.
      - Policy violation rate.
    - We sample a subset of runs weekly for human review and label correctness and safety.
    - Evaluator Agent:
      - Uses metrics and annotated runs to suggest prompt/policy tweaks.
      - Proposals are reviewed by humans before applying.
    
    ## Rollout & Risk Management
    - Start with read-only tools only (logs and metrics); ticket creation is gated behind a flag.
    - Introduce agents gradually (planner + logs first, then metrics, then fix-draft).
    - Monitor metrics and policy violations; rollback to a simpler single-agent fallback if needed.
